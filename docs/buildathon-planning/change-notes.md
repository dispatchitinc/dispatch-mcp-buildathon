## MVP Focus Rationale

**Core Goal**: Deliver a working proof of concept that demonstrates conversational AI interface for Dispatch orders and pricing estimates.

**MVP Success Criteria**:
- MCP server can create estimates
- MCP server can create orders  
- Basic UI can interact with MCP tools
- End-to-end order creation flow works
- Demo proves the concept works

**What This Achieves**:
- Proves the technical feasibility
- Demonstrates business value
- Shows conversational interface capability
- Validates core functionality
- Provides foundation for future development

## Document Relationships

### **Primary Documents**:
- `buildathon-timeline-plan.md` - Original comprehensive timeline
- `buildathon-timeline-plan-mvp.md` - MVP-focused timeline
- `project-research.md` - Project background and team information
- `change-notes.md` - This document (change tracking)

### **Supporting Documents**:
- `ai-agent-implementation-guide.md` - Technical implementation guidance
- `api-endpoints-analysis.md` - API research and analysis
- `build-plan.md` - High-level build strategy
- `mcp-implementation-research.md` - MCP framework research

## Future Version Planning

### **Potential Version 3.0 - Post-MVP Enhancement**
**Planned Features** (if MVP succeeds):
- Advanced UI features and responsive design
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Advanced error handling and retry logic
- Performance optimization
- Advanced prompt engineering
- Comprehensive documentation
- Advanced testing scenarios
- Stakeholder communication materials
- Post-buildathon planning

### **Version Control Strategy**:
- Keep original comprehensive version for reference
- Use MVP version for actual buildathon execution
- Create enhancement version if MVP succeeds
- Document lessons learned and improvements

---

## Change Log

### **October 3, 2025**
- **Initial Creation**: Created comprehensive timeline with full feature set
- **MVP Focus**: Stripped out non-essential features to focus on core functionality
- **Documentation**: Added change tracking and version control
- **Rationale**: Focus on proving concept rather than building production-ready system

---

## Notes and Considerations

### **Why MVP Focus**:
- **Time Constraint**: 3 days is limited for comprehensive development
- **Proof of Concept**: Goal is to demonstrate feasibility, not production readiness
- **Team Capacity**: Focus on core functionality ensures success
- **Stakeholder Value**: Working demo is more valuable than incomplete advanced features

### **Future Considerations**:
- If MVP succeeds, plan for production-ready version
- Document lessons learned during buildathon
- Identify which advanced features would add most value
- Plan for gradual enhancement rather than big-bang approach

*This document will be updated as the buildathon progresses and new versions are created.*
