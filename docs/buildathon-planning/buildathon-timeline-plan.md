## Risk Mitigation and Contingency Plans

### **Technical Risks**
1. **Authentication Issues**: Fallback to REST endpoints if GraphQL auth is complex
2. **API Rate Limits**: Implement retry logic and caching
3. **MCP Framework Issues**: Use simpler HTTP client approach if needed

### **Timeline Risks**
1. **Scope Creep**: Focus on MVP - core order creation and estimates only
2. **Integration Issues**: Start with simple test cases, build complexity gradually
3. **UI Complexity**: Use Claude desktop if web UI becomes too complex

### **Team Risks**
1. **Knowledge Gaps**: Pair programming sessions for knowledge transfer
2. **Dependencies**: Parallel work streams to minimize blocking
3. **Quality**: Code reviews and testing at each milestone
